 What's New for Links2 PSP Port
================================

links-2.1pre23 PSP rxxxx (2006-08-xx)
NEW FEATURES
(raf) Changed default background color from gray to white (for html).
(raf) UP/DOWN in html now scroll up/down (without R+)
(raf) UP/DOWN at the top/bottom of a menu list will wrap (user request).
BUG FIXES
(raf) Fixed openssl compile options (-mno-explicit-relocs), this fixes the problem where the Links2 plugin wasn't working. (You will need to upgrade openssl from the pspdev svn to rev.2169 or greater).

links-2.1pre23 PSP r1231 (2006-08-09)
NEW FEATURES
(raf) Using a new mouse cursor (Edited off of the freely available theme http://www.kde-look.org/content/show.php?content=13524)
(raf) Implemented h/w double buffering to go along the s/w double buffering (more like triple buffering). This solves the flickering of danzeff.
(raf) Slowed down the mouse pointer a bit. Also made this a configuration item (mouse_speed_factor).
(raf) Renamed config item psp_bb_to_fb_factor to screen_zoom_factor
(raf) Added support for 16bpp to danzeff
(raf) Modified links to use 16bpp; this saves a lot of memory.
BUG FIXES
(raf) Cleaned up the call to the input handler. This resolved some timing issues that were causing the graphic glitches (menu screens not clearing up correctly).

links-2.1pre23 PSP r1222 (2006-08-04)
NEW FEATURES
(raf) Cookie save/restore patch from cvs.pld.org.pl/SOURCES/links2-cookies-save.patch?rev=1.2 applied.
(raf) Merged to 2.1pre23 See Changelog.orig
(raf) Made psp_bb_to_fb_factor a configurable parameter in links.cfg (default=1, set to 2 to enable zoom mode)
(raf) Also changed default font to 12 from 24. (Change to 24 in html.cfg if want to use zoom mode)
BUG FIXES
(raf) Reverted UP/DOWN behavior (user requested). (R+UP/DOWN still does page up/down, though).

links-2.1pre22 PSP r1214 (2006-07-08)
NEW FEATURES
(raf) Updates to pspgu driver: 
	-Default resolution is now 960x544 (Its scaled down to the PSP's 480x272)
	-Links scaling is now disabled (as it used too much memory, and was one of the main culprits of memory errors)
	-Font size changed from 12 to 24, so it is readable without zoom (at 960x544)
	-Zoom (along with new virtual resolution of 960x544 implemented using a kind of double buffering).
(raf) New button mappings: 
	UP/DOWN = scroll up/scroll down (former R+UP/DOWN)
	R+UP/DOWN = page up/page down
	L (held) = zoom (while L is held). Use analog stick to move around.
	L+CROSS = toggles zoom lock. (Once locked, the analog will control the mouse. Use L+analog to move zoom window).
BUG FIXES

links-2.1pre22 PSP r1206 (2006-07-03)
NEW FEATURES
